## About me, in brief

#### This is my personal website

##### I am a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in Chelsea Specht's lab at Cornell University. My dissertation research focuses on the population genetics, floral trait evolution, and ecological diversity of mariposa lilies, Calochortus (Liliaceae).

##### My other passion is creating space and support for under-represented minorities in science and academia. As a first-generation immigrant and first-generation scholar, I recognize that my success is built upon the guidance of mentors. As a graduate student, I have focused my efforts on mentoring URM undergraduate students through research experiences and workshops, and supporting fellow graduate students through fellowship application workshops and events.
