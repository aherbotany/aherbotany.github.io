## About me, in brief

<br>

#### This is my personal website - Welcome!

#### I am a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in Chelsea Specht's lab at Cornell University. My dissertation research focuses on the population genetics, floral trait evolution, and ecological diversity of mariposa lilies, Calochortus (Liliaceae).

#### My other passion is creating space and support for under-represented minorities in science and academia. As a first-generation immigrant and first-generation scholar, I recognize that my success is built upon the guidance of mentors so I strive to mentor and uplift students like me into higher education.
