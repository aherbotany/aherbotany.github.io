## About me, in brief

<br>

#### Welcome! This is my personal website

#### I am a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in Dr. Chelsea Specht's lab at Cornell University, School of Integrative Plant Science, Plant Biology Section. My dissertation research focuses on the population genetics, floral trait evolution, and ecological diversity of mariposa lilies, Calochortus (Liliaceae).

#### My other passion is creating space and support for under-represented minorities in science and academia. As a first-generation immigrant and first-generation scholar, I recognize that my success is built upon the guidance of mentors. I strive to mentor and uplift historically marginalized students into higher education.
