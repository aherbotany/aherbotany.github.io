#### About me, in brief

#### Welcome to my personal website

#### My passion for exploring the natural world and learning natural history has driven me to a research career in plant evolutionary biology.

#### I am a rising 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in [Dr. Chelsea Specht's lab](https://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/) at Cornell University, School of Integrative Plant Science, Plant Biology Section. My dissertation research focuses on the **population genetics, the genomics and floral trait evolution, and the ecological diversity of mariposa lilies, <i>Calochortus</i>** (Liliaceae).

#### My other passion is creating space and support for historically marginalized communities in science and academia. As a first-generation immigrant and first-generation scholar, I recognize that my success is built upon the guidance of mentors. I strive to mentor and uplift historically marginalized students into higher education.
