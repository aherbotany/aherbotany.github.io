#### Background

##### When I was an undergraduate student in biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, my home was in the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program in the office of Dr. Inés Talamantez. Inés welcomed my perspective as a first-generation immigrant, the first in my family to attend college, and a woman who struggled to merge traditional Mexican culture with Western academia. As an indigenous woman, Inés taught me that like much of institutionalized American culture, our perspective of scholarship is dominated by Eurocentric ideals. The lack of representation and inclusion deters many great minds from engaging in academia, research, and higher education overall. This has largely shaped my teaching philosophy to engage students on a personal level and tailor my teaching to cultivate an inclusive and supportive setting.

I reproduced historical herbarium specimens of California Channel Island native plants for an exhibit on the natural history of the Channel Islands to commemorate the opening of the Pritzlaff Conservation Center at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, Santa Barbara, California, July 2016. Many of these specimens were collected by renown California botanists, providing the opportunity to introduce the work of historical botanists to visitors of the exhibit and how their work is used to this day. These reproduced specimens helped illustrate to students and visitors the use of herbaria in documenting and characterizing biodiversity, and reconstructing changes in phenology, climate, biogeography, and vegetation communities.
