#### Background

##### When I was an undergraduate student in biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, my home was in the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program in the office of Dr. Inés Talamantez. Inés welcomed my perspective as a first-generation immigrant, the first in my family to attend college, and a woman who struggled to merge traditional Mexican culture with Western academia. As an indigenous woman, Inés taught me that like much of institutionalized American culture, our perspective of scholarship is dominated by Eurocentric ideals. The lack of representation and inclusion deters many great minds from engaging in academia, research, and higher education overall. This has largely shaped my teaching philosophy to engage students on a personal level and tailor my teaching to cultivate an inclusive and supportive setting.
