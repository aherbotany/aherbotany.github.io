#### As a graduate student, I have focused my efforts on mentoring URM undergraduate students through research experiences, workshops, and graduate school recruitment. I have also developed opportunities for graduate students to build on their experiences in order to provide effective and tailored mentorship to their undergraduate mentees. Many of my the mentorship and outreach projects I am involved in outside of the lab and field are held through the Graduate School at Cornell as I am currently serving as a Graduate Student Ambassador.

#### I also greatly enjoy engaging children in building hypothesis, expanding their curiosity, and integrating art and science.
> For example, I worked with fellow graduate students at Cornell to create a virtual plant workshop for [Expanding Your Horizons](https://www.eyh.cornell.edu/virtualEYH/activities.php), which is focuses on engaging girls in junior high to do science and see themselves as scientists. We created a website with a diversity of content on botany that can be accessed here: [Virtual Plant Workshop 2020](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/virtualplantworkshop/home?authuser=0)
