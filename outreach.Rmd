#### As a graduate student, I have focused my efforts on mentoring URM undergraduate students through research experiences, workshops, and graduate school recruitment.

#### I really enjoy engaging children in building hypothesis, expanding their curiosity, and integrating art and science.
> I worked with fellow graduate students at Cornell to create a virtual plant workshop for [Expanding Your Horizons](https://www.eyh.cornell.edu/virtualEYH/activities.php), which is focuses on engaging girls in junior high to do science and see themselves as scientists. We created a website with a diversity of content on botany that can be accessed here: [Virtual Plant Workshop 2020](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/virtualplantworkshop/home?authuser=0)
